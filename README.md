# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis on Kickstarter campaigns to uncover funding and outcome trends in theatrical projects in 2017 and 2018.

## Overview of Project
To better anticipate the success of the play *Fever*, we looked at trends in funding based on various data points provided by the client. We focused first on the success of other theatrical Kickstarter campaigns based on when they began their project and how much funding was requested, as well as the location of the campaign's origin. The findings presented here are a more refined projection of how long it took for other theatrical Kickstarter campaigns to be funded, so that we may better be able to anticipate the success of *Fever*.
